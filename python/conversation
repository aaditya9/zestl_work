yes
wait


btw - use teh debugger here. its far better
let me show you


ok.
can you json.loads the variable i was looking at
ac['actions'][3]['data'] i think


and try to find out why what is printing is different from what you see there
whats printing seems more correct

k wait
 in credetials url version V1 is present that's why it is giving like this
  now both are same

ok. is this working now?
else print that which i asked for
ac['actions'][3]['data']
ok


hang on
yes


done
worked??

minal?
if it worked then change this from a hard coding to something you find out
how will you do that?

yes it is worked

so where did i get that value from? its written in the file itself.
you need to extract it from there

what are you doing?
did i say copy from another file?
no

taking help from there

.
 so i dont want it done that way
 i showed you where this ifo is
 let me know if not clr

 i am not geeting what u want exactly
 i want you to find pid
 i told you where it is

yes

C capital
ok


so when you send data over the internet protocls etc you cant just send ket data pairs (brackets, braces etc)
so the data needs to be sent as a "string"
that is done by encoding
the menthod of encoding here is called json
json.dumps creates a string
json.loads converts string to original format


it is v difficult to reference things from a string - so we convert to original format and start referencing

there can be encoded jsons inside encoded jsons etc - so keep looking out for that

thats json in a nutshell

what is next ?

start working on siddharth thing
at least for 1 user write a script that creates what he needs

k
i will try to create form content
